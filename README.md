CSS Element Compare
===================

Chrome extension to allow developers to compare the CSS rules being applied to an element on two URLs

When cosmetic defects have been identified during regression testing, it can be difficult to track down exactly what is causing the defect.
This tool allows you to enter two URLs and a CSS selector.
It will then fetch the DOM of both URLs, display them in iframes, and show you which CSS rules are being applied to the elements matching your selector.


Usage
-----
# Install the Chrome extension
# Enter two URLs
# Enter a CSS selector
